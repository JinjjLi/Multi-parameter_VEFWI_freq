Line 1: optimization type. Currently, we should only put 2 because only the truncated Gauss-Newton approach is implemented.

Line 2: number of outer iterations. Model in each band should be updated with this number.

Line 3: maximum iterations in approximating the inverse Hessian.

Line 4: parameter that controls the optimization. This parameter does not to be changed in most scenarios.

Line 5: regularization factor. This parameter does not to be changed as well.
