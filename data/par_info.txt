Line1: numbers of grid points in x and z directions

Line2: grid intervals in x and z directions

Line3: PML thickness

Line4: acquisition settings. Seperately for sources and receivers. 
       coverage:
       1 - surface
       2 - left
       3 - right
       4 - bottom
       5 - top and left
       6 - top and right
       7 - top and bottom
       8 - right and left
       9 - all

Line5: offset of sources and receivers. This parameter sets where the array starts.
       The default values are zeros. Usually it does not need to change.

Line6: parameters for spacial Gaussian basis functions. 
       The first value is P_grid, which is the spacing between basis functions in both x and z.
       The second one is P_smooth, and this is proportional to the size of the basis functions. 
       Note: P_smooth does not reduce to the conventional expression when set to 0.

Line7: nP is to define the amount of inversion variables. 
       means:
       1 - only density
       2 - density and VP
       3 - density, VP, and QP
       4 - density, VP, QP, and VS
       5 - density, VP, QP, VS, and QS

Line8: frequency parameters. 
       The first value is the number of total bands, while the second one is how many subfrequencies within each band.

Line9: the first parameter is the lowest frequency of each band. Should be lowest useable frequency.
       the second parameter is the max frequency of the first band.
       the last one is the max frequency of the last band.

Line10: the amplitude scale.

Line11: the reference frequency.

Line12: file name of the true model. Note that the "../data/" should be kept.

Line13: file name of the initial model. Note that the "../data/" should be kept.
